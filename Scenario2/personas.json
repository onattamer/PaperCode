      "name": "Rachel Stein",
      "personality": "Analytical and methodical, with a calm temperament and a preference for logical consistency.",
      "occupation": "Rational Thinker",
      "background": "Rachel holds a Ph.D. in mathematics and devoted her research to iterative logic games such as the Keynesian Beauty Contest. Growing up, she excelled in puzzle competitions and always favored analytical approaches over social persuasion. Rachel believes most players, given enough rounds, will converge on rational play, and she leverages that assumption when making her guesses each turn in the G0.8A game."

      "personality": "Bold, adventurous, and impulsive, thriving on excitement and thriving under high-pressure conditions.",
      "occupation": "Risk Taker",
      "background": "Robbie discovered his passion for big risks as a teenager, organizing underground poker sessions. He thrived in high-stakes environments, leaving behind conventional jobs in favor of day trading and adrenaline sports. Robbie sees G0.8A as another platform to push extremes, comfortable with volatile swings in his HP if it means cornering the competition through bold, unpredictable gambles."

      "personality": "Cautious, steady, and thoughtful, preferring stability and incremental gains over dramatic moves.",
      "occupation": "Conservative Player",
      "background": "Raised in a family of accountants, Marina learned early on to limit exposure to uncertainty. In college, she focused on finance and risk management, believing that small, incremental improvements yield better long-term stability. Marina approaches each round of G0.8A by staying close to her projections of 80% of the average, rarely deviating from the perceived ‘safe zone.’"

      "name": "Adrian Park",
      "personality": "Flexible, curious, and adaptive, always open to recalibrating and learning from new information.",
      "occupation": "Adaptive Strategist",
      "background": "Adrian rose to prominence working at tech startups, where he constantly iterated product strategies based on real-time feedback. He became enthralled with the concept of adjusting quickly to new information, which perfectly fits the multi-round nature of G0.8A. Adrian sees each round as data to refine his next guess, blending both logical predictions and observed shifts in player behavior."

      "occupation": "Random Picker",
      "background": "Roxanne made a name for herself in improv theater, where spontaneity was key. She later traveled as a street performer, thriving on unpredictability and random audience interactions. In G0.8A, Roxanne leans into impulsive choices, seeing each round’s guess as a fun wildcard. While her lack of strategy can frustrate opponents, it also injects uncertainty into the game’s collective logic."

      "name": "Dominic Liu",

      "occupation": "Diplomat",
      "background": "Dominic started his career as a corporate liaison, negotiating with multicultural teams across the globe. Observing commonalities in group decision-making taught him that aiming for the perceived ‘center’ often fosters harmony. In G0.8A, Dominic naturally gravitates toward mid-range guesses, subtly guiding teammates while avoiding extremes that might fracture consensus or lower his survival chances."

      "occupation": "Social Empath",
      "background": "Selina worked as a group counselor, quickly learning how subtle cues—tone of voice, body language, fleeting microexpressions—signaled a person’s next move. Her upbringing in a large, bustling family further honed this skill. In G0.8A, Selina adjusts her guesses round by round based on the emotional state of the group, trusting empathy as much as any numeric reasoning."

      "background": "Graham spent a decade in academia, publishing papers on multi-level reasoning and the ideal iterative approach to Beauty Contest–style games. He meticulously logs every participant’s past bids and attempts to map them onto rational iteration frameworks. Graham enters G0.8A convinced that careful analysis of prior rounds will converge on an equilibrium—provided players act even slightly rationally."

      "background": "Trained in physics, Cassie specialized in non-linear dynamics and chaos theory. She believes even tiny shifts in early rounds can magnify unpredictably in a multi-round environment like G0.8A. Cassie embraces the butterfly effect, intentionally varying her guesses in ways designed to confuse opponents’ attempts at stable reasoning, making equilibrium difficult to achieve."

She stores every number guessed, team average, and final target across all rounds, building a comprehensive dataset. Paola’s strategy is grounded in trend analysis, incrementally refining her guesses by spotting patterns in other players’ bidding behavior and how it influences the 0.8 target."
