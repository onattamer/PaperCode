        "Each player (on all teams) must choose an integer between 1 and 100 in each round. "
        "First, the overall average of numbers chosen by *all* players is calculated. "
        "The round's TARGET number is then determined as (0.8 * this overall average). "
        "Next, the average number chosen by the members of *each team* is calculated. "
        "The TEAM whose team average is closest to the TARGET number wins the round. "
        "Members of the winning team DO NOT lose any HP. "
        "All players on the OTHER teams lose 1 HP. "
        "If there's a tie (two or more teams are equally close to the target, or all team averages are identical), "

        "Cindy chooses 20, David chooses 30. (Team B)\n\n"
        "1. Calculate Overall Average: (50 + 60 + 20 + 30) / 4 = 160 / 4 = 40.\n"
        "2. Calculate Target: 0.8 * Overall Average = 0.8 * 40 = 32.\n"
        "3. Calculate Team A's Average: (50 + 60) / 2 = 55.\n"
        "4. Calculate Team B's Average: (20 + 30) / 2 = 25.\n"
        "5. Compare Team Averages to Target:\n"
        "   - Team A: |Team Average 55 - Target 32| = 23\n"
        "   - Team B: |Team Average 25 - Target 32| = 7\n"
        "6. Determine Winner: Team B's average (25) is closer to the Target (32) than Team A's average (55).\n"
        "7. Result: Team B wins. Cindy and David lose 0 HP. Alex and Bob (from Team A) lose 1 HP each.\n\n"
        "General Rules Reminder:\n"
        "Every player starts with an initial HP of 10 points. "
        "Once a player's HP reaches 0, they are eliminated. "
        "The game continues until only players from one team remain, or a maximum round limit is reached. "
        "Strive to coordinate with your team to make choices that get your TEAM AVERAGE closest to the target (0.8 * overall average) to maximize your team's survival!"
